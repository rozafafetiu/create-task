# Task Management

## Front-end angular application project

This is the project is used for testing potential candidates to join our front-end team.

## Technical requirements

Build an angular front-end application that allows users to create "Task"

A task is defined as an item of work that a user creates. The necessary fields are (but you are free to extend the model):

- Title: A short, descriptive name of the task.
- Description: A long description of the task.
- Start Date: A date that the user created the task.
- End Date: A date that the user hopes to finish.
- Status: A status of the task (New, Process, Completed).

## Description

Build your own public repository on GitHub or fork from this template, and call it whatever you like. Build your application in your repo.
After completing the project, email the source code or URL for your GitHub repository to blabl@abc-softwaredev.com.

One of the major goals of this project is to see how you fill in ambiguities in your own creative way.
There is no such thing as a perfect project here, just interpretations of the instructions above. So, be creative in your approach.

## Technology

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
